      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <img src="assets/images/cat.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="William McLaughlin">

      <p>I am a graduate of Mississippi State University who now resides in the Dallas/Fort Worth area. I moved to Dallas/Fort Worth from Memphis three years ago. My favorie part about living in the Dallas/Fort Worth area is the fact that a few of my best friends live here and have helped me to make new friends. I am currently studying web development at SMU.</p>

      <p>My parents and younger brother still live in Memphis.  My parents were in the pharmaceutical industry for many years and went to pharmacy school at Purdue University.  My brother is a Mechanical Engineer and is a graduate of Texas A&M University. My family means everything to me and I visit them whenever I can.  Without them, I would not be the person that I am today.</p>

      <p>I like playing sports in order to stay active.  I also run and ride my bicycle frequently for my other main forms of physical activity.  I also like attending sporting events, especially Dallas Stars games.  I also enjoy travelling because it allows me to see more of the country and the world.  I am especially happy when I get to travel with family or friends.  It is my goal to see as much of the world as I can in my lifetime.</p>
